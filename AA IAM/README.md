# Coffee Shop Full Stack

## Full Stack Nano - Identity and access management

Udacity has decided to open a new digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. They need assistance in creating a comprehensive drink menu application to enhance the customer experience.

Your task is to demonstrate your newly acquired skills by developing a full stack drink menu application that meets the following requirements:

1. Display visually appealing graphics representing the ingredient ratios of each drink.
2. Allow public users to view drink names and associated graphics.
3. Provide baristas with access to recipe information for each drink.
4. Enable shop managers to create new drinks and modify existing drinks.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main components:

1. Backend: The ./backend directory contains a Flask server with a SQLAlchemy module. This server handles API requests and interacts with the database.

Refer to the README.md within the ./backend directory for more details.

2. Frontend: The ./frontend directory contains a complete Ionic frontend that consumes data from the Flask server. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the drink menu.

Refer to the README.md within the ./frontend directory for more details.
