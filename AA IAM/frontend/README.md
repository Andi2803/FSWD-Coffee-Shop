# Coffee Shop Frontend

## Getting Started

This frontend is designed to work with the Flask-based Backend. It is recommended to set up the backend first, test it using Postman, and then integrate the frontend for smooth operation.

## Installing Dependencies

## Installing Node.js and NPM

This project requires Node.js and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before proceeding, make sure to download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download. The NPM package will be included with the Node.js installation.

## Installing Ionic CLI

The Ionic Command Line Interface (CLI) is necessary for serving and building the frontend. Instructions for installing the CLI can be found in the Ionic Framework Docs.

## Installing Project Dependencies

This project utilizes NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM relies on the package.json file located in the frontend directory of this repository. After cloning the project, navigate to your terminal and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Running the Frontend in Development Mode

Ionic provides a convenient development server that detects changes and transpiles the code in real-time. The application can be accessed through the browser using a localhost port. To start the development server, navigate to the frontend directory in your terminal and execute the following command:

```
ionic serve
```
